# Training MNIST model with Cloud ML Engine

This example guides you through the steps required for training and serving an
MNIST model with the cloud ML engine.

A great notebook that will guide you through the steps, is
`02-mnist-model-with-cloudml-client.ipynb`. In this notebook, you will use the
python discovery client for the cloud ML engine to trigger a training job, create
a model, deploy a model version and request a prediction from the model that has
been deployed.
